String manipulation
===============================

**I found that a lot of the things I was missing are available in the IntelliJ "String Manipulation" plugin.** https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162-string-manipulation/

This is (the beginning of) a library for string manipulation. This includes things like:

* Filtering lines
* Search and replace (regex)
* Splitting into columns

It's implemented in Rust and intended to also compile to WebAssembly (wasm).
